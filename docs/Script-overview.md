# Scripts

Scripts are an additional datasource for information that isn't collected by a task.

## Script output

Scripts should output to stdout. All output to stdout is collected and saved in a file based on the name of the script, ie: `name-of-script.out`. This is saved in the directory specified by `-output-path`, defaulting to the current directory.

Scripts can also output files. Files should be created in the current working directory. If `-output-path` is used, the current working directory will be set to the path specified. All output files are included in the results zip in the `ScriptOutput/` directory.

## Script results

The results of running a script can be found in the `nrdiag-output.json` file with the following schema:

```json
"Script": {
    "Name": "example",
    "Description": "Example Description",
    "Output": "example output",
    "OutputFiles": [
        "/path/to/example.out",
        "/path/to/another-file.out"
    ],
    "OutputTruncated": false
}
```

The `Output` field contains the stdout output. If it is over 20000 characters, it is truncated and the `OutputTruncated` field is set to `true`. Even if trucated, the full output is still available in the `ScriptOutput/` directory in the zip file.

A list of files the script created can be found in the `OutputFiles` field.

## Adding to the script catalog

### File structure

Scripts are located in `scriptcatalog/scripts/`. Each script must also have a yml file associated with it, located in `scriptcatalog/`.
